## 7 Weeks After

Just seven weeks after [Joseph’s March 1842 Masonic initiation](https://www.cesletter.org/temples/2), Joseph introduced the LDS endowment ceremony in [May 1842](https://www.cesletter.org/temples/3).

## True Masonry

President Heber C. Kimball, a Mason himself and a member of the First Presidency for 21 years, made the following statement:

<IndentedQuote
  quote="We have the true Masonry. The Masonry of today is received from the apostasy which took place in the days of Solomon, and David. They have now and then a thing that is correct, but we have the real thing."

## Same Masonic Version

If Masonry had the original Temple ceremony but became distorted over time, why doesn’t the LDS ceremony more closely resemble an earlier form of Masonry, which would be more correct rather than the exact version that Joseph Smith was exposed to in his March 1842 Nauvoo, Illinois initiation?

## Zero Links to Solomon's Temple

Freemasonry has zero links to Solomon’s Temple. Although more a Church folklore, with origins from comments made by early Mormon Masons such as Heber C. Kimball, than being Church doctrine, it’s a myth that the endowment ceremony has its origins from Solomon’s Temple or that Freemasonry passed down parts of the endowment over the centuries from Solomon’s Temple. Solomon’s Temple was all about animal sacrifice. [Freemasonry has its origins to stone tradesmen in medieval Europe](https://www.cesletter.org/temples/5) – not in 950 BC Jerusalem.

FairMormon admits these facts:

<IndentedQuote
  quote="Unfortunately, there is no historical evidence to support a continuous functioning line from Solomon’s Temple to the present. We know what went on in Solomon’s Temple; it’s the ritualistic slaughter of animals."

<IndentedQuote
  quote="Masonry, while claiming a root in antiquity, can only be reliably traced to medieval stone tradesmen."

<IndentedQuote
  quote="It is clear that Freemasonry and its traditions played a role in the development of the endowment ritual..."
  source="Similarities Between Masonic and Mormon Temple Ritual"

If there’s no connection to Solomon’s Temple, what’s so divine about a man-made medieval
European secret fraternity and its rituals?

## Temple Changes

Why did the Church remove the blood oath penalties and the 5 Points of Fellowship at the veil from the endowment ceremony in 1990? Both of these were 100% Masonic rituals. What does this say about the Temple and the endowment ceremony if 100% pagan Masonic rituals were in it from its inception? What does it say about the Church if it removed something that Joseph Smith said he restored and which would never again be taken away from the earth?

## Secret Tokens & Signs

Is God really going to require individuals to know secret tokens, handshakes, and signs to get into heaven? What is the purpose of them? [Doesn’t Heavenly Father know our names and know us personally? Indeed, aren’t the very hairs on our heads numbered?](https://www.cesletter.org/temples/9) And couldn’t those who have left the Church and still know of the secret tokens, handshakes, and signs (or those who have watched the endowment ceremony on YouTube) benefit from that knowledge?

## Separate Families?

Does the eternal salvation, eternal happiness, and eternal families really depend on Masonic rituals in multi-million dollar castles? Is God really going to separate good couples and their children who love one another and who want to be together in the next life because they object to uncomfortable and strange Masonic Temple rituals and a polygamous heaven?
