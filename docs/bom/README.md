What are 1769 King James Version edition [errors](https://cesletter.org/bom/3) doing in the Book of Mormon? A purported ancient text? Errors which are unique to the 1769 edition that Joseph Smith owned?

### 2

When King James translators were translating the KJV Bible between 1604 and 1611, they would occasionally put in their own words into the text to make the English more readable. We know exactly what these words are because they're italicized in the KJV Bible. What are these 17th century italicized words doing in the Book of Mormon? Word for word? What does this say about the Book of Mormon being an ancient record?

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="ISAIAH 9:1 (KJV)"
  quote="Nevertheless the dimness **shall** not **be** such as *was* in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her **by** the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations."
/>

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="2 NEPHI 19:1"
  quote="Nevertheless, the dimness **shall** not **be** such as *was* in her vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterwards did more grievously afflict **by** the way of the **Red** Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations."
/>

The above example, [2 Nephi 19:1](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/4), dated in the Book of Mormon to be around 550 BC, quotes nearly verbatim from the 1611 AD translation of [Isaiah 9:1 KJV](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/5) – including the translators’ italicized words. Additionally, the Book of Mormon describes the sea as the Red Sea. The problem with this is that (a) Christ quoted Isaiah in [Matt. 4:14-15](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/6) and did not mention the Red Sea, (b) “Red” sea is not found in any source manuscripts, and (c) the Red Sea is 250 miles away.

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="MALACHI 3:10 (KJV)"
  quote="...and pour you out a blessing, that **there shall** not **be room** enough **to receive it**."
/>

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="3 NEPHI 24:10"
  quote="...and pour you out a blessing that **there shall** not **be room** enough **to receive it**."
/>

In the above example, the KJV translators added 7 italicized words to their English translation, which are not found in the source Hebrew manuscripts. Why does the Book of Mormon, which is supposed to have been completed by Moroni over 1,400 years prior, contain the exact identical seven italicized words of 17th century translators?

The Book of Mormon includes mistranslated biblical passages that were later changed in Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible. These Book of Mormon verses should match the inspired JST version instead of the incorrect KJV version that Joseph later fixed. A typical example of the differences between the BOM, the KJV, and the JST:

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="3 NEPHI 13:25-27"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/7"
  quote="25: ...Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
  26: Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
  27: Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?"
/>

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="MATTHEW 6:25-27"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/8"
  description="(From the King James Version Bible – not the JST)"
  quote="25: Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
  26: Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
  27: Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?"
/>

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="MATTHEW 6:25-27"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/9"
  description="(Joseph Smith Translation of the same passages in the LDS Bible)"
  quote="25: And, again, I say unto you, Go ye into the world, and care not for the world: for the world will hate you, and will persecute you, and will turn you out of their synagogues.
  26: Nevertheless, ye shall go forth from house to house, teaching the people; and I will go before you.
  27: And your heavenly Father will provide for you, whatsoever things ye need for food, what ye shall eat; and for raiment, what ye shall wear or put on."
/>

Christ's Sermon on the Mount in the Bible and the Book of Mormon are identical. But Joseph Smith later corrected the Bible. In doing so, he also contradicted the same identical Sermon on the Mount passage in the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon is “the most correct book” and was translated a mere decade before the JST. The Book of Mormon was not corrupted over time and did not need correcting. How is it that the Book of Mormon has the incorrect Sermon on the Mount passage and does not match the correct JST version in the first place?

[DNA analysis](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/10) has concluded that Native American Indians do not originate from the Middle East or from Israelites but rather from Asia. Why did the Church change the following section of the introduction page in the [2006 edition](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/11) Book of Mormon, shortly after the DNA results were released?

<BeforeAfterComparison
  before="...the Lamanites, and they are **the principal** ancestors of the American Indians"
  after="...the Lamanites, and they are **among the** ancestors of the American Indians"
/>

_UPDATE_: The Church conceded in its January 2014 [Book of Mormon and DNA Studies](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/12) essay that the majority of Native Americans carry largely Asian DNA. The Church, through this essay, makes a major shift in narrative from its past dominant narrative and claims of the origins of the Native American Indians.

Anachronisms: Horses, cattle, oxen, sheep, swine, goats, elephants, wheels, chariots, wheat, silk, steel, and iron [did not exist in pre-Columbian America](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/13) during Book of Mormon times. Why are these things mentioned in the Book of Mormon as being made available in the Americas between 2200 BC - 421 AD?

Unofficial apologists claim victories in some of these items but closer inspection reveals significant problems. It has been documented that apologists have manipulated wording so that steel is not steel, sheep become never-domesticated bighorn sheep, horses become tapirs, etc.

### 6

Archaeology: There is absolutely [no archaeological evidence](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/14) to directly support the Book of Mormon or the Nephites and Lamanites, who were supposed to have numbered in the millions. This is one of the reasons why unofficial apologists have developed the [Limited Geography Model](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/15) (it happened in Central or South America) and claim that the Hill Cumorah mentioned as the final battle of the Nephites is not in Palmyra, New York but is elsewhere. This is in direct contradiction to what Joseph Smith and [other prophets have taught](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/16). It also makes little sense in light of the Church’s visitor’s center near the Hill Cumorah in New York and the annual Church-sponsored Hill Cumorah pageants.

We read about two major war battles that took place at the Hill Cumorah (Ramah to the Jaredites) with deaths numbering in the tens of thousands – the last battle between Lamanites and Nephites around 400 AD claimed at least 230,000 deaths on the Nephite side alone. No bones, hair, chariots, swords, armor, or any other evidence of a battle whatsoever has been found at this site. John E. Clark, director of BYU’s archaeological organization, wrote in the [Journal of Book of Mormon Studies](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/17):

<IndentedQuote quote="In accord with these general observations about New York and Pennsylvania, we come to our principal object – the Hill Cumorah. Archaeologically speaking, it is a clean hill. No artifacts, no walls, no trenches, no arrowheads. The area immediately surrounding the hill is similarly clean. Pre-Columbian people did not settle or build here. This is not the place of Mormon’s last stand. We must look elsewhere for that hill."/>

Compare this with the archaeological evidence of other hillside battle sites. [Caerau Hillfort](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/18), in the Wales capital of Cardiff, was found to have abundant archaeological evidence of inhabitants and weapons of war dating as far back as 3600 BC in the form of stone arrowheads, tools, and pottery.

Compare the absent evidence of Book of Mormon civilizations to the archaeological remains of other past civilizations such as the [Roman occupation of Britain](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/19) and other countries. There are abundant evidences of their presence during the first 400 years AD such as villas, mosaic floors, public baths, armor, weapons, writings, art, pottery, and so on. Even the major road systems used today in some of these occupied countries were built by the Romans. Additionally, there is ample evidence of the Mayan and Aztec civilizations as well as a [civilization in current day Texas that dates back at least 15,000 years](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/20). Another recent discovery has been made of a [14,000-year-old village in Canada](https://cesletter.org/bom/20A).

Admittedly, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but where are the Nephite or Lamanite buildings, roads, armors, swords, pottery, art, etc.? How can these great civilizations just vanish without a trace? Latter-day Saint Thomas Stuart Ferguson was the founder of BYU’s archaeology division (New World Archaeological Foundation). NWAF was financed by the LDS Church. NWAF and Ferguson were tasked by BYU and the Church in the 1950s and 1960s to find [archaeological evidence](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/21) to support the Book of Mormon. After 17 years of diligent effort, this is what Ferguson wrote in a [February 20, 1976](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/22) letter about trying to dig up evidence for the Book of Mormon:

<IndentedQuote quote="...you can’t set Book of Mormon geography down anywhere – because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archaeology. I should say – what is in the ground will never conform to what is in the book." />

Book of Mormon Geography: Many Book of Mormon names and places are strikingly similar to many local names and places of the region where Joseph Smith lived.

The following two maps show Book of Mormon geography compared to Joseph Smith’s geography.

<ImageWithCaption src="/images/placeholder.jpg" title="Book of Mormon Geography" />

<ImageWithCaption src="/images/placeholder.jpg" title="Joseph Smith's Geography" above="(Northeast United States & Southeast Canada)" />

The first map is the “proposed map,” constructed from internal comparisons in the Book of Mormon.

Throughout the Book of Mormon we read of such features as “The Narrow Neck of Land” which was a day and a half’s journey (roughly 30 miles) separating two great seas. We also read about the Hill Onidah and the Hill Ramah – all place names in the land of Joseph Smith’s youth.

We read in the Book of Mormon of the city of Teancum named for a warrior named Teancum who helped General Moroni fight in the Land of Desolation. In Joseph’s era, an Indian Chief named [Tecumseh](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/23) fought and died near the narrow neck of land in helping the British in the War of 1812. Today, the city [Tecumseh](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/24) (near the narrow neck of land) is named after this Chief.

We see the Book of Mormon city Kishkumen located near an area named, on modern maps, as [Kiskiminetas](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/25). There are more than a dozen Book of Mormon names that are the same as or nearly the same as modern geographical locations.

Why are there so many names similar to Book of Mormon names in the region where Joseph Smith lived? Is this really all just a coincidence?

_UPDATE_: Additional information and analysis can be found at [cesletter.org/maps](https://cesletter.org/maps/)

#### HILL CUMORAH

Off the eastern coast of Mozambique in Africa is an island country called “[Comoros](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/26).” Prior to its French occupation in 1841, the islands were known by its Arabic name, “Camora.” There is an 1808 map of Africa that refers to the islands as “Camora.”

<ImageWithCaption src="/images/placeholder.jpg" below="Camora is near center in the above [1808 Map of Africa](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/27)" />

The largest city and capital of Comoros (formerly “Camora”)? [Moroni](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/28). “Camora” and settlement “Moroni” were names in pirate and treasure hunting stories involving Captain William Kidd (a pirate and treasure hunter) which many 19th century New Englanders – especially treasure hunters – were familiar with.

In fact, the uniform spelling for Hill Cumorah in the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon is spelled “[Camorah](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/29).”

Pomeroy Tucker was born in Palmyra, New York in 1802, three years before Joseph Smith. He is considered to be a contemporary source. This is what he said about Joseph Smith:

<QuoteWithReference
  quote="Joseph ... had learned to read comprehensively ... [reading] works of fiction and records of criminality, such for instance as would be classed with the ‘dime novels’ of the present day. The stories of Stephen Buroughs and Captain Kidd, and the like, presented the highest charms for his expanding mental perceptions"
  source="Mormonism: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress, p.17"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/30"
/>

Some apologists say that Tucker’s Mormonism: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress is “anti- Mormon” and thus anything in the book cannot be trusted. If this is true, why then did LDS scholar and Church History compiler B.H. Roberts quote Tucker for background information on Joseph Smith? Also, FairMormon has an [article](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/31) in which they quote Tucker’s book 4 times as support for Joseph, and they even refer to Tucker as an “eyewitness” to Joseph and his family. Is Tucker’s peripheral information only useful and accurate when it shows Joseph and the Church in a positive and favorable light?

<QuoteWithReference
  quote="We are sorry to observe, even in this enlightened age, so prevalent a disposition to credit the accounts of the marvellous. Even the frightful stories of money being hid under the surface of the earth, and enchanted by the Devil or Robert Kidd [Captain Kidd], are received by many of our respectable fellow citizens as truths."
  source="Wayne Sentinel, Palmyra, New York, February 16, 1825"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/32"
/>

Notice that this is considered “prevalent” and “received by many of our respectable fellow citizens as truths.” The above contemporary newspaper quote from Palmyra, New York, in 1825 was not tainted by any desire to damage Joseph Smith. This article provides a snapshot of the worldview of 1825 New England.

The Hill Cumorah and Moroni have absolutely nothing to do with Camora and Moroni from Captain Kidd stories? Stories that Joseph and his treasure hunting family, friends, and community were familiar with? The original 1830 Book of Mormon just happens to have the uniform “Camorah” spelling? This is all just a mere coincidence?
