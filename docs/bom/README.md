What are 1769 King James Version edition [errors](https://cesletter.org/bom/3) doing in the Book of Mormon? A purported ancient text? Errors which are unique to the 1769 edition that Joseph Smith owned?

## 2

When King James translators were translating the KJV Bible between 1604 and 1611, they would occasionally put in their own words into the text to make the English more readable. We know exactly what these words are because they're italicized in the KJV Bible. What are these 17th century italicized words doing in the Book of Mormon? Word for word? What does this say about the Book of Mormon being an ancient record?

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="ISAIAH 9:1 (KJV)"
  quote="Nevertheless the dimness **shall** not **be** such as *was* in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her **by** the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations."
/>

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="2 NEPHI 19:1"
  quote="Nevertheless, the dimness **shall** not **be** such as *was* in her vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterwards did more grievously afflict **by** the way of the **Red** Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations."
/>

The above example, [2 Nephi 19:1](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/4), dated in the Book of Mormon to be around 550 BC, quotes nearly verbatim from the 1611 AD translation of [Isaiah 9:1 KJV](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/5) – including the translators’ italicized words. Additionally, the Book of Mormon describes the sea as the Red Sea. The problem with this is that (a) Christ quoted Isaiah in [Matt. 4:14-15](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/6) and did not mention the Red Sea, (b) “Red” sea is not found in any source manuscripts, and (c) the Red Sea is 250 miles away.

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="MALACHI 3:10 (KJV)"
  quote="...and pour you out a blessing, that **there shall** not **be room** enough **to receive it**."
/>

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="3 NEPHI 24:10"
  quote="...and pour you out a blessing that **there shall** not **be room** enough **to receive it**."
/>

In the above example, the KJV translators added 7 italicized words to their English translation, which are not found in the source Hebrew manuscripts. Why does the Book of Mormon, which is supposed to have been completed by Moroni over 1,400 years prior, contain the exact identical seven italicized words of 17th century translators?

The Book of Mormon includes mistranslated biblical passages that were later changed in Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible. These Book of Mormon verses should match the inspired JST version instead of the incorrect KJV version that Joseph later fixed. A typical example of the differences between the BOM, the KJV, and the JST:

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="3 NEPHI 13:25-27"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/7"
  quote="25: ...Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
  26: Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
  27: Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?"
/>

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="MATTHEW 6:25-27"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/8"
  description="(From the King James Version Bible – not the JST)"
  quote="25: Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
  26: Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
  27: Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?"
/>

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="MATTHEW 6:25-27"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/9"
  description="(Joseph Smith Translation of the same passages in the LDS Bible)"
  quote="25: And, again, I say unto you, Go ye into the world, and care not for the world: for the world will hate you, and will persecute you, and will turn you out of their synagogues.
  26: Nevertheless, ye shall go forth from house to house, teaching the people; and I will go before you.
  27: And your heavenly Father will provide for you, whatsoever things ye need for food, what ye shall eat; and for raiment, what ye shall wear or put on."
/>

Christ's Sermon on the Mount in the Bible and the Book of Mormon are identical. But Joseph Smith later corrected the Bible. In doing so, he also contradicted the same identical Sermon on the Mount passage in the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon is “the most correct book” and was translated a mere decade before the JST. The Book of Mormon was not corrupted over time and did not need correcting. How is it that the Book of Mormon has the incorrect Sermon on the Mount passage and does not match the correct JST version in the first place?

[DNA analysis](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/10) has concluded that Native American Indians do not originate from the Middle East or from Israelites but rather from Asia. Why did the Church change the following section of the introduction page in the [2006 edition](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/11) Book of Mormon, shortly after the DNA results were released?

<BeforeAfterComparison
  before="...the Lamanites, and they are **the principal** ancestors of the American Indians"
  after="...the Lamanites, and they are **among the** ancestors of the American Indians"
/>

___UPDATE___: The Church conceded in its January 2014 [Book of Mormon and DNA Studies](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/12) essay that the majority of Native Americans carry largely Asian DNA. The Church, through this essay, makes a major shift in narrative from its past dominant narrative and claims of the origins of the Native American Indians.

Anachronisms: Horses, cattle, oxen, sheep, swine, goats, elephants, wheels, chariots, wheat, silk, steel, and iron [did not exist in pre-Columbian America](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/13) during Book of Mormon times. Why are these things mentioned in the Book of Mormon as being made available in the Americas between 2200 BC - 421 AD?

Unofficial apologists claim victories in some of these items but closer inspection reveals significant problems. It has been documented that apologists have manipulated wording so that steel is not steel, sheep become never-domesticated bighorn sheep, horses become tapirs, etc.

## 6

Archaeology: There is absolutely [no archaeological evidence](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/14) to directly support the Book of Mormon or the Nephites and Lamanites, who were supposed to have numbered in the millions. This is one of the reasons why unofficial apologists have developed the [Limited Geography Model](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/15) (it happened in Central or South America) and claim that the Hill Cumorah mentioned as the final battle of the Nephites is not in Palmyra, New York but is elsewhere. This is in direct contradiction to what Joseph Smith and [other prophets have taught](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/16). It also makes little sense in light of the Church’s visitor’s center near the Hill Cumorah in New York and the annual Church-sponsored Hill Cumorah pageants.

We read about two major war battles that took place at the Hill Cumorah (Ramah to the Jaredites) with deaths numbering in the tens of thousands – the last battle between Lamanites and Nephites around 400 AD claimed at least 230,000 deaths on the Nephite side alone. No bones, hair, chariots, swords, armor, or any other evidence of a battle whatsoever has been found at this site. John E. Clark, director of BYU’s archaeological organization, wrote in the [Journal of Book of Mormon Studies](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/17):

<IndentedQuote quote="In accord with these general observations about New York and Pennsylvania, we come to our principal object – the Hill Cumorah. Archaeologically speaking, it is a clean hill. No artifacts, no walls, no trenches, no arrowheads. The area immediately surrounding the hill is similarly clean. Pre-Columbian people did not settle or build here. This is not the place of Mormon’s last stand. We must look elsewhere for that hill."/>

Compare this with the archaeological evidence of other hillside battle sites. [Caerau Hillfort](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/18), in the Wales capital of Cardiff, was found to have abundant archaeological evidence of inhabitants and weapons of war dating as far back as 3600 BC in the form of stone arrowheads, tools, and pottery.

Compare the absent evidence of Book of Mormon civilizations to the archaeological remains of other past civilizations such as the [Roman occupation of Britain](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/19) and other countries. There are abundant evidences of their presence during the first 400 years AD such as villas, mosaic floors, public baths, armor, weapons, writings, art, pottery, and so on. Even the major road systems used today in some of these occupied countries were built by the Romans. Additionally, there is ample evidence of the Mayan and Aztec civilizations as well as a [civilization in current day Texas that dates back at least 15,000 years](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/20). Another recent discovery has been made of a [14,000-year-old village in Canada](https://cesletter.org/bom/20A).

Admittedly, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but where are the Nephite or Lamanite buildings, roads, armors, swords, pottery, art, etc.? How can these great civilizations just vanish without a trace? Latter-day Saint Thomas Stuart Ferguson was the founder of BYU’s archaeology division (New World Archaeological Foundation). NWAF was financed by the LDS Church. NWAF and Ferguson were tasked by BYU and the Church in the 1950s and 1960s to find [archaeological evidence](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/21) to support the Book of Mormon. After 17 years of diligent effort, this is what Ferguson wrote in a [February 20, 1976](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/22) letter about trying to dig up evidence for the Book of Mormon:

<IndentedQuote quote="...you can’t set Book of Mormon geography down anywhere – because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archaeology. I should say – what is in the ground will never conform to what is in the book." />

Book of Mormon Geography: Many Book of Mormon names and places are strikingly similar to many local names and places of the region where Joseph Smith lived.

The following two maps show Book of Mormon geography compared to Joseph Smith’s geography.

<ImageWithCaption src="/images/placeholder.jpg" title="Book of Mormon Geography" />

<ImageWithCaption src="/images/placeholder.jpg" title="Joseph Smith's Geography" above="(Northeast United States & Southeast Canada)" />

The first map is the “proposed map,” constructed from internal comparisons in the Book of Mormon.

Throughout the Book of Mormon we read of such features as “The Narrow Neck of Land” which was a day and a half’s journey (roughly 30 miles) separating two great seas. We also read about the Hill Onidah and the Hill Ramah – all place names in the land of Joseph Smith’s youth.

We read in the Book of Mormon of the city of Teancum named for a warrior named Teancum who helped General Moroni fight in the Land of Desolation. In Joseph’s era, an Indian Chief named [Tecumseh](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/23) fought and died near the narrow neck of land in helping the British in the War of 1812. Today, the city [Tecumseh](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/24) (near the narrow neck of land) is named after this Chief.

We see the Book of Mormon city Kishkumen located near an area named, on modern maps, as [Kiskiminetas](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/25). There are more than a dozen Book of Mormon names that are the same as or nearly the same as modern geographical locations.

Why are there so many names similar to Book of Mormon names in the region where Joseph Smith lived? Is this really all just a coincidence?

### HILL CUMORAH

Off the eastern coast of Mozambique in Africa is an island country called “[Comoros](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/26).” Prior to its French occupation in 1841, the islands were known by its Arabic name, “Camora.” There is an 1808 map of Africa that refers to the islands as “Camora.”

<ImageWithCaption src="/images/placeholder.jpg" below="Camora is near center in the above [1808 Map of Africa](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/27)" />

The largest city and capital of Comoros (formerly “Camora”)? [Moroni](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/28). “Camora” and settlement “Moroni” were names in pirate and treasure hunting stories involving Captain William Kidd (a pirate and treasure hunter) which many 19th century New Englanders – especially treasure hunters – were familiar with.

In fact, the uniform spelling for Hill Cumorah in the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon is spelled “[Camorah](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/29).”

Pomeroy Tucker was born in Palmyra, New York in 1802, three years before Joseph Smith. He is considered to be a contemporary source. This is what he said about Joseph Smith:

<QuoteWithReference
  quote="Joseph ... had learned to read comprehensively ... [reading] works of fiction and records of criminality, such for instance as would be classed with the ‘dime novels’ of the present day. The stories of Stephen Buroughs and Captain Kidd, and the like, presented the highest charms for his expanding mental perceptions"
  source="Mormonism: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress, p.17"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/30"
/>

Some apologists say that Tucker’s Mormonism: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress is “anti- Mormon” and thus anything in the book cannot be trusted. If this is true, why then did LDS scholar and Church History compiler B.H. Roberts quote Tucker for background information on Joseph Smith? Also, FairMormon has an [article](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/31) in which they quote Tucker’s book 4 times as support for Joseph, and they even refer to Tucker as an “eyewitness” to Joseph and his family. Is Tucker’s peripheral information only useful and accurate when it shows Joseph and the Church in a positive and favorable light?

<QuoteWithReference
  quote="We are sorry to observe, even in this enlightened age, so prevalent a disposition to credit the accounts of the marvellous. Even the frightful stories of money being hid under the surface of the earth, and enchanted by the Devil or Robert Kidd [Captain Kidd], are received by many of our respectable fellow citizens as truths."
  source="Wayne Sentinel, Palmyra, New York, February 16, 1825"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/32"
/>

Notice that this is considered “prevalent” and “received by many of our respectable fellow citizens as truths.” The above contemporary newspaper quote from Palmyra, New York, in 1825 was not tainted by any desire to damage Joseph Smith. This article provides a snapshot of the worldview of 1825 New England.

The Hill Cumorah and Moroni have absolutely nothing to do with Camora and Moroni from Captain Kidd stories? Stories that Joseph and his treasure hunting family, friends, and community were familiar with? The original 1830 Book of Mormon just happens to have the uniform “Camorah” spelling? This is all just a mere coincidence?

Reverend Ethan Smith was the author of _View of the Hebrews_. Ethan Smith was a pastor in Poultney, Vermont when he wrote and published the book. Oliver Cowdery – also a Poultney, Vermont resident – was [a member of Ethan’s congregation](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/38) during this time and before he went to New York to [join his distant cousin](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/39) Joseph Smith. As you know, Oliver Cowdery played an instrumental role in the production of the Book of Mormon.

This direct link between Joseph and Oliver and _View of the Hebrews_ demonstrates that Joseph is very likely to have been aware of the theme and content of that book. It gives weight to all the similarities described in the preceding comparison chart. Apologists may point out that the Book of Mormon is not a direct, word-for-word plagiarism of _View of the Hebrews_, and indeed that is not the claim. Rather, the similarities should give any reader pause that two books so similar in theme and content would coincidentally be connected by Oliver Cowdery.

LDS General Authority and scholar [Elder B.H. Roberts](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/40) privately researched the link between the Book of Mormon and the _View of the Hebrews_, [Joseph’s father having the same dream in 1811 as Lehi’s dream](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/41), and other sources that were available to Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris and others before the publication of the Book of Mormon. Elder Roberts’ private research was meant only for the eyes of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve and was never intended to be available to the public. However, Roberts’ work was [later published](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/42) in 1985 as [Studies of the Book of Mormon](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/43). Based upon his research, Elder B.H. Roberts came to the following conclusion on the _View of the Hebrews_:

<QuoteWithReference
  quote="Did Ethan Smith’s View of the Hebrews furnish structural material for Joseph Smith’s Book of Mormon? It has been pointed out in these pages that there are many things in the former book that might well have suggested many major things in the other. Not a few things merely, one or two, or a half dozen, but many; and it is this fact of many things of similarity and the cumulative force of them that makes them so serious a menace to Joseph Smith’s story of the Book of Mormon’s origin."
  attribution="B.H. Roberts"
  source="Studies of the Book of Mormon, p.240"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/bom/43"
/>

While this does not prove that the Book of Mormon was plagiarized from the _View of the Hebrews_, it does demonstrate that key elements of the story of the Book of Mormon – i.e. Native Americans as Hebrew descendants, ancient records of natives preserved, scattering and gathering of Israel, Hebrew origin of Native American language, etc. pre-dated the Book of Mormon and were already among the ideas circulating among New England protestant Americans.

With these ideas already existing and the previously cited issues with KJV plagiarism, errors, anachronisms, geography problems, and more issues to come, is it unreasonable to question Joseph Smith’s story of the Book of Mormon origins as Church Historian B.H. Roberts did?

[The Late War Between the United States and Great Britain](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/44): This book was an 1819 textbook written for New York state school children. The book depicted the events of the War of 1812 and it was specifically written in a Jacobean English style to imitate the King James Bible. This affected scriptural style was calculated to elevate the moral themes, characters and events depicted in the narrative to inspire the readers to “patriotism and piety.” Readers already accustomed to revere scriptural sounding texts in the ancient Bible would be predisposed to revere this history book which employs the same linguistic style.

The [first chapter](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/45) alone is stunning as it reads incredibly like the Book of Mormon:

<ScriptureQuote
  quote="1: Now it came to pass, in the one thousand eight hundred and twelfth year of the christian era, and in the thirty and sixth year after the people of the provinces of Columbia had declared themselves a free and independent nation;
  2: That in the sixth month of the same year, on the first day of the month, the chief Governor, whom the people had chosen to rule over the land of Columbia;
  3: Even James, whose sir-name was Madison, delivered a written paper to the Great Sannhedrim of the people, who were assembled together.
  4: And the name of the city where the people were gathered together was called after the name of the chief captain of the land of Columbia, whose fame extendeth to the uttermost parts of the earth; albeit, he had slept with his fathers..."
/>

In addition to the above KJV language style present throughout the book, what are the following Book of Mormon verbatim phrases, themes, and storylines doing in a children’s school textbook that was used in Joseph Smith’s own time and backyard – all of this a mere decade before the publication of the Book of Mormon?

* Devices of “curious workmanship” in relation to boats and weapons.
* A “stripling” soldier “with his “weapon of war in his hand.”
* “A certain chief captain...was given in trust a band of more than two thousand chosen men, to go forth to battle” and who “all gave their services freely for the good of their country.”
* Fortifications: “the people began to fortify themselves and entrench the high Places round about the city.”

The parallels and similarities to the Book of Mormon are astounding. This [web page](https://cesletter.org/bom/46) outlines very clearly and simply just how phenomenally unlikely it is that so many common rare phrases and themes could be found between these books without the _Late War_ having had some influence on the Book of Mormon.

ormer BYU Library Bibliographic Dept. Chairman and antique book specialist Rick Grunder states in his analysis of [The Late War (p.770)](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/48):

<IndentedQuote quote="The presence of Hebraisms and other striking parallels in a popular children’s textbook (Late War), on the other hand – so close to Joseph Smith in his youth – must sober our perspective." />

Another fascinating book published in 1809, _[The First Book of Napoleon](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/49)_:

The [first chapter](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/50):

<ScriptureQuote
  quote="1. And behold it came to pass, in these latter days, that an evil spirit arose on the face of the earth, and greatly troubled the sons of men.
  2. And this spirit seized upon, and spread amongst the people who dwell in the land of Gaul.
  3. Now, in this people the fear of the Lord had not been for many generations, and they had become a corrupt and perverse people; and their chief priests, and the nobles of the land, and the learned men thereof, had become wicked in the imagines of their hearts, and in the practices of their lives.
  4. And the evil spirit went abroad amongst the people, and they raged like unto the heathen, and they rose up against their lawful king, and slew him, and his queen also, and the prince their son; yea, verily, with a cruel and bloody death.
  5. And they moreover smote, with mighty wrath, the king’s guards, and banished the priests, and nobles of the land, and seized upon, and took unto themselves, their inheritances, their gold and silver, corn and oil, and whatsoever belonged unto them.
  6. Now it came to pass, that the nation of the Gauls continued to be sorely troubled and vexed, and the evil spirit whispered unto the people, even unto the meanest and vilest thereof..." />

...and it continues on. It’s like reading from the Book of Mormon. When I first read this along with other passages from _The First Book of Napoleon_, I was floored. Here we have two early 19th century contemporary books written at least a decade before the Book of Mormon that not only read and sound like the Book of Mormon but also contain so many of the Book of Mormon’s parallels and themes as well.

The following is a side-by-side comparison of selected phrases the Book of Mormon is known for from the beginning portion of the Book of Mormon with the same order in the beginning portion of _The First Book of Napoleon_ (note: these are not direct paragraphs):

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="THE FIRST BOOK OF NAPOLEON"
  quote="Condemn not the (writing)...an account...the First Book of Napoleon... upon the face of the earth...it came to pass...the land...their inheritances their gold and silver and...the commandments of the Lord...the foolish imaginations of their hearts...small in stature...Jerusalem...because of the perverse wickedness of the people." />

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="BOOK OF MORMON"
  quote="Condemn not the (writing)...an account...the First Book of Nephi... upon the face of the earth...it came to pass...the land...his inheritance and his gold and his silver and...the commandments of the Lord...the foolish imaginations of his heart...large in stature...Jerusalem...because of the wickedness of the people." />

The Book of Mormon taught and still teaches a Trinitarian view of the Godhead. Joseph Smith’s early theology also held this view. As part of the over [100,000 changes](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/51) to the Book of Mormon, there were major changes made to reflect Joseph’s evolved view of the Godhead.

In addition to these revised passages, the following verses are among many verses still in the Book of Mormon that can be read with a Trinitarian view of the Godhead:

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="Alma 11:38-39"
  link="https://cesletter.org/bom/62"
  quote="38: Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?
  39: And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;" />

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="Mosiah 15:1-4"
  link="https://cesletter.org/bom/63"
  quote="1: And now Abinadi said unto them: I would that ye should understand that God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people.
  2: And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of God, and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father, being the Father and the Son –
  3: The Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son –
  4: And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth." />

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="Ether 3:14-15"
  link="https://cesletter.org/bom/64"
  quote="14: Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters.
  15: And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image." />

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="Mosiah 16:15"
  link="https://cesletter.org/bom/65"
  quote="15: “Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father. Amen.”" />

Boyd Kirkland made the following [observation](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/66):

<IndentedQuote quote="The Book of Mormon and early revelations of Joseph Smith do indeed vividly portray a picture of the Father and Son as the same God...why is it that the Book of Mormon not only doesn’t clear up questions about the Godhead which have raged in Christianity for centuries, but on the contrary just adds to the confusion? This seems particularly ironic, since a major avowed purpose of the book was to restore lost truths and end doctrinal controversies caused by the “great and abominable Church’s” corruption of the Bible...In later years he [Joseph] reversed his earlier efforts to completely ‘monotheise’ the godhead and instead ‘tritheised’ it." />

___UPDATE___: Additional information and analysis can be found at [cesletter.org/trinitarian](http://cesletter.org/trinitarian)

Assuming that the official [1838 first vision account](https://www.cesletter.org/bom/67) is truthful and accurate, why would Joseph Smith hold a Trinitarian view of the Godhead if he personally saw God the Father and Jesus Christ as separate and embodied beings a few years earlier in the Sacred Grove?
