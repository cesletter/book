## 1

Originally, Joseph claimed that this record was written by Abraham “[by his own hand, upon papyrus](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/2)” – a claim still prominent in the heading of the Book of Abraham. This claim could not be evaluated for decades as many thought the papyri were lost in a fire. The original papyrus Joseph translated has since been found and, as stated in the Church’s July 2014 _[Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham](https://www.cesletter.org/boa)_ essay, “scholars have identified the papyrus fragments as parts of standard funerary texts...[that] date to between the third century B.C.E. and the first century C.E., long after Abraham lived.”

We know this is the papyrus that Joseph used for translation because the hieroglyphics match in chronological order to the hieroglyphics in Joseph’s _[Kirtland Egyptian Papers](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/4)_, which contains his _[Grammar & Alphabet of the Egyptian Language](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/5)_ (GAEL). Additionally, the papyrus were pasted onto paper which have drawings of a temple and maps of the Kirtland, Ohio area on the back and they were companied by an affidavit by Emma Smith verifying they had been in the possession of Joseph Smith.

[Egyptologists have also since translated the source material](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/6) for the Book of Abraham and have found it to be nothing more than a common pagan Egyptian funerary text for a deceased man named “Hor” around first century C.E. In other words, it was a common Breathing Permit that the Egyptians buried with their dead. It has nothing to do with Abraham or anything Joseph claimed in his translation for the Book of Abraham. The Church admits this in its [essay](https://www.cesletter.org/boa):

<IndentedQuote quote="None of the characters on the papyrus fragments mentioned Abraham’s name or any of the events recorded in the book of Abraham.

One of the most disturbing facts I discovered in my research of Facsimile 2 is figure #7. Joseph Smith said that this is “God sitting on his throne...” It’s actually [Min](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/15), the pagan Egyptian god of fertility or sex. Min is sitting on a throne with an erect penis (which can be seen in the figure). In other words, Joseph interpreted that this figure with an erect penis is Heavenly Father sitting on His throne.

## 3

Respected non-LDS Egyptologists state that Joseph Smith’s translation of the papyri and facsimiles are gibberish and have absolutely nothing to do with the papyri and facsimiles and what they actually say.

#### Facsimile 1 {."spaced-title text-center"}

1. The names are wrong.
2. The Abraham scene is wrong.
3. He names gods that are not part of the Egyptian belief system; of any known mythology or belief system.

#### Facsimile 2 {."spaced-title text-center"}

1. Joseph translated 11 figures on this facsimile. None of the names are correct and none of the gods exist in Egyptian religion or any recorded mythology.
2. Joseph misidentifies every god in this facsimile.

#### Facsimile 3 {."spaced-title text-center"}

1. Joseph misidentifies the Egyptian god [Osiris](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/19) as Abraham.
2. Misidentifies the Egyptian god [Isis](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/20) as the Pharaoh.
3. Misidentifies the Egyptian god [Maat](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/21) as the Prince of the Pharaoh.
4. Misidentifies the Egyptian god [Anubis](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/21) as a slave.
5. Misidentifies the dead Hor as a waiter.
6. Joseph misidentifies – twice – a female as a male.

[The Book of Abraham teaches an incorrect Newtonian view of the universe](https://cesletter.org/pdf/mormon-cosmology.pdf). These Newtonian astronomical concepts, mechanics, and models of the universe have since been succeeded and substantially modified by 20th century Einsteinian physics.

What we find in Abraham 3 and the official scriptures of the LDS Church regarding science reflects a Newtonian world concept. Just as the Catholic Church's Ptolemaic cosmology was displaced by the new Copernican and Newtonian world model, however, the nineteenth-century, canonized, Newtonian world view has since been displaced by Einstein's twentieth-century science.

[Keith E. Norman, an LDS scholar](https://cesletter.org/pdf/mormon-cosmology.pdf), has written that for the LDS Church:

<IndentedQuote quote="It is no longer possible to pretend there is no conflict." />

Norman continues:

<IndentedQuote quote="Scientific cosmology began its leap forward just when Mormon doctrine was becoming stabilized. The revolution in twentieth-century physics precipitated by Einstein dethroned Newtonian physics as the ultimate explanation of the way the universe works. Relativity theory and quantum mechanics, combined with advances in astronomy, have established a vastly different picture of how the universe began, how it is structured and operates, and the nature of matter and energy. This new scientific cosmology poses a serious challenge to the Mormon version of the universe." />

Grant Palmer, a Mormon historian and CES teacher for 34 years, wrote:

<QuoteWithReference
  quote="Many of the astronomical and cosmological ideas found in both Joseph Smith’s environment and in the Book of Abraham have become out of vogue, and some of these Newtonian concepts are scientific relics. The evidence suggests that the Book of Abraham reflects concepts of Joseph Smith’s time and place rather than those of an ancient world."
  source="An Insider’s View of Mormon Origins, p.25"
  link="https://cesletter.org/boa/24"
/>

## 5

86% of Book of Abraham chapters 2, 4, and 5 are King James Version Genesis chapters 1, 2, 11, and 12. Sixty-six out of seventy-seven verses are quotations or close paraphrases of King James Version wording. (See [An Insider’s View of Mormon Origins, p.19](https://cesletter.org/boa/24))


If the Book of Abraham is an ancient text written thousands of years ago “by his own hand upon papyrus,” then what are 17th century King James Version text doing in there? What does this say about the book being anciently written by Abraham?

## 6

Why are there anachronisms in the Book of Abraham? For example, [the terms Chaldeans, Egyptus, and Pharaoh are all anachronistic](https://cesletter.org/boa/26). Additionally, Abraham refers to the facsimiles in [1:12](https://cesletter.org/boa/27) and [1:14](https://cesletter.org/boa/28). However, as noted and conceded above in the Church’s essay, these facsimiles did not even exist in Abraham’s time as they are standard first century C.E. pagan Egyptian funerary documents.

Facsimile 2, Figure #5 states the sun receives its “light from the revolutions of Kolob.” We now know, however, that the process of nuclear fusion is what makes the stars and suns shine. With the discovery of quantum mechanics, scientists learned that the sun’s source of energy is internal and not external. The sun shines because of thermonuclear fusion. The sun does not shine because it gets its light from any other star or any other external source.

There is a book published in 1829 by Thomas Dick entitled _[The Philosophy of a Future State](https://cesletter.org/boa/29)_. Joseph Smith [owned a copy](https://cesletter.org/boa/30) of the book and Oliver Cowdery quoted some lengthy excerpts from the book in the [December 1836 Messenger and Advocate](https://cesletter.org/boa/31).

Klaus Hansen, an LDS scholar, stated:

<IndentedQuote quote="The progressive aspect of Joseph’s theology, as well as its cosmology, while in a general way compatible with antebellum thought, bears some remarkable resemblances to Thomas Dick’s ‘Philosophy of a Future State’." />

Hansen continues:

<IndentedQuote
  quote="Some very striking parallels to Smith’s theology suggest that the similarities between the two may be more than coincidental. Dick’s lengthy book, an ambitious treatise on astronomy and metaphysics, proposed the idea that matter is eternal and indestructible and rejected the notion of a creation ex nihilo. Much of the book dealt with the infinity of the universe, made up of innumerable stars spread out over immeasurable distances. Dick speculated that many of these stars were peopled by ‘various orders of intelligences’ and that these intelligences were ‘progressive beings’ in various stages of evolution toward perfection. In the Book of Abraham, part of which consists of a treatise on astronomy and cosmology, eternal beings of various orders and stages of development likewise populate numerous stars. They, too, are called ‘intelligences.’ Dick speculated that ‘the systems of the universe revolve around a common centre...the throne of God.’ In the Book of Abraham, one star named Kolob ‘was nearest unto the throne of God.’ Other stars, in ever diminishing order, were placed in increasing distances from this center."

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland was directly asked about the papyri not matching the Book
of Abraham in a March 2012 [BBC interview](https://cesletter.org/boa/33):

  quote="(Interrupts) All I’m saying...all I’m saying is that what got translated got translated into the word of God. The vehicle for that, I do not understand and don’t claim to know and know no Egyptian."

Is “I don’t know and I don’t understand but it’s the word of God” really the best answer that a “prophet, seer, and revelator” can come up with to such a profound problem and stumbling block that is driving many members out of the Church?

The following are respected Egyptian scholars/Egyptologists statements regarding Joseph Smith and the Book of Abraham:

<IndentedQuote
  quote="...these three facsimiles of Egyptian documents in the Pearl of Great Price depict the most common objects in the Mortuary religion of Egypt. Joseph Smith’s interpretations of them as part of a unique revelation through Abraham, therefore, very clearly demonstrates that he was totally unacquainted with the significance of these documents and absolutely ignorant of the simplest facts of Egyptian writing and civilization."

In addition to the above, world renowned and respected University of Chicago professor of Egyptology, Dr. Robert Ritner, provided a detailed response and rebuttal to the LDS Church’s [Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham](https://www.cesletter.org/boa) essay that is sobering and devastating. Dr. Ritner’s rebuttal to the Church’s essay can be read [here](https://www.cesletter.org/boa/6).

The following [video](https://www.cesletter.org/papyri) offers a thorough, complete, and unbiased overview of the Book of Abraham issues as well as the apologetic responses to them:

An online contributor created an [easy-to-understand document](https://cesletter.org/boa/40) very clearly outlining the Book of Abraham issues. Contrary to what some Mormon apologists claim or imply, a person does not have to be an Egyptologist or a scholar with a PhD to clearly understand the Book of Abraham problems and challenges to Joseph Smith’s claims of being a translator.

Of all the issues, the Book of Abraham is the issue that has both fascinated and disturbed me the most. It is the issue that I’ve spent the most time researching because it offers a real insight into Joseph’s modus operandi as well as Joseph’s claim of being a translator. It is the smoking gun that has completely obliterated my testimony of Joseph Smith and his claims.
