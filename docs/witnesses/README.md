At the end of the day? It all doesn’t matter. The Book of Mormon Witnesses and their testimonies of the gold plates are irrelevant. It does not matter whether eleven 19th century treasure diggers with magical worldviews saw some gold plates or not. It doesn’t matter because of this one simple fact:

#### JOSEPH DID NOT USE THE GOLD PLATES FOR TRANSLATING THE BOOK OF MORMON {."spaced-title text-center"}

The testimony of the Three and Eight Witnesses to the Book of Mormon is a key part to the testimonies of many members of the Church. Some even base their testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon on these 11 witnesses and their claims. As a missionary, I was instructed to teach investigators about the testimonies of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon as part of boosting the book’s credibility.

There are several critical problems for relying and betting on these 19th century men as credible witnesses.

## Magical Worldview

In order to truly understand the Book of Mormon witnesses and the issues with their claims, one must understand the magical worldview of many people in early 19th century New England. These are people who believed in folk magic, divining rods, visions, second sight, peep stones in hats, treasure hunting (money digging or glass looking), and so on.

Many people believed in buried treasure, the ability to see spirits and their dwelling places within the local hills and elsewhere. This is one reason why treasure digging as a paid service was practiced. Joseph Smith, his father, and his brother Hyrum had engaged in treasure hunting from 1820–1827. Joseph was hired by folks like Josiah Stowell, who Joseph mentions in his [history](https://cesletter.org/witnesses/1). In 1826, Joseph was [arrested](https://cesletter.org/witnesses/2) and brought to court in Bainbridge, New York on the complaint of Stowell’s nephew who accused Joseph of being a “disorderly person and an imposter.”

It would not have been unusual during this time for a neighbor, friend, or even a stranger to come up to you and say, “I received a vision of the Lord!” and for you to respond, in all seriousness, “Well, what did the Lord say?”

This is one of the reasons why 21st century Mormons, once including myself, are so confused and bewildered when hearing stuff like Joseph Smith using a peep stone in a hat or Oliver Cowdery using a [divining rod or dowsing rod](https://cesletter.org/witnesses/3) such as illustrated below:

<ImageWithCaption src="/images/placeholder.jpg" />

The use of divining rods (such as the one above) is actually mentioned in the scriptures. In Doctrine & Covenants 8, the following heading provides context for the discussion:

<IndentedQuote quote="Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. In the course of the translation of the Book of Mormon, Oliver, who continued to serve as scribe, writing at the Prophet’s dictation, desired to be endowed with the gift of translation. The Lord responded to his supplication by granting this revelation." />

The revelation states, in relevant part:

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="D&C 8:6-11"
  description="(Emphasis Added)"
  quote="6. Now this is not all thy gift; for you have another gift, which is the **gift of Aaron**; behold, it has told you many things;
  7. Behold, there is no other power, save the power of God, that can cause this gift of Aaron to be with you.
  8. Therefore, doubt not, **for it is the gift of God; and you shall hold it in your hands**, and **do marvelous works**; and no power shall be able to take it away out of your hands, **for it is the work of God**.
  9. And, therefore, **whatsoever you shall ask me to tell you by that means, that I will grant unto you**, and you shall have knowledge concerning it.
  10. Remember that **without faith you can do nothing; therefore ask in faith**. Trifle not with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not.
  11. Ask that you may know the mysteries of God, and **that you may translate and receive knowledge from all those ancient records which have been hid up, that are sacred**; and according to your faith shall it be done unto you."
/>

From the D&C 8 account, we don’t really know much about what exactly the “gift of Aaron” is that Oliver Cowdery received. What is “the gift of Aaron”? The text provides several clues:

* Oliver has a history of using it, since “it has told [him] many things.”
* It is “the gift of God.”
* It is to be held in Oliver’s hands (and kept there, impervious to any power).
* It allows Oliver to “do marvelous works.”
* It is “the work of God.”
* The Lord will speak through it to Oliver and tell him anything he asks while using it.
* It works through faith.
* It enables Oliver to translate ancient sacred documents.

With only these clues, the “gift of Aaron” is difficult to identify. The task becomes much easier, however, when we look at the original revelation contained in the Book of Commandments, a predecessor volume to the Doctrine & Covenants, used by the LDS Church before 1835. Specifically, [Section 7 of the Book of Commandments](https://www.cesletter.org/witnesses/5) contains wording that was changed in the [Doctrine & Covenants 8](https://www.cesletter.org/witnesses/6). The term “gift of Aaron” was originally “rod” and “rod of nature” in the Book of Commandments:

<IndentedQuote
  quote="Now this is not all, for you have another gift, which is the gift of working with the rod: behold it has told you things: behold there is no other power save God, that can cause this **rod of nature**, to work in your hands."
  source="The Book of Commandments 7:37 (emphasis added)"
  link="https://www.cesletter.org/witnesses/5"
/>

So, what is the “gift of Aaron” mentioned in D&C 8? It is a “rod of nature.”

What is a “rod of nature”? It is a divining rod or dowsing rod as illustrated in the above images, which Oliver Cowdery used to hunt for buried treasure.

Cowdery’s use of a divining rod to search for buried treasure evokes similar images of Joseph Smith hunting for treasure with a peep stone in a hat. Oliver also wished to use his divining rod, in the same way Joseph Smith used his stone and hat, to translate ancient documents. Doctrine & Covenants Section 8 indicates that the Lord, through Joseph Smith, granted Oliver’s request to translate using a...rod.

If Oliver Cowdery’s gift was really the use of a divining rod – and it was – then this tells us that the origins of the Church are much more rooted in folk magic and superstition than we’ve been led to believe by the LDS Church’s whitewashing of its origins and history.

## Witnesses

We are told that the witnesses never disavowed their testimonies, but we have not come to know these men or investigated what else they said about their experiences.

They are 11 witnesses to the Book of Mormon: Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, Hiram Page, David Whitmer, John Whitmer, Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer Jr., Hyrum Smith, Samuel Smith, and Joseph Smith Sr. – who all shared a common worldview of second sight, magic, and treasure digging – which is what drew them together in 1829.

The following are several facts and observations on three of the Book of Mormon Witnesses:

<ImageWithCaption bottomTitle="Martin Harris" src="/images/placeholder.jpg" />

Martin Harris was anything but a skeptical witness. He was known by many of his peers as an unstable, gullible, and superstitious man. Brigham Young once said of Martin:

<IndentedQuote
  quote="As for Martin Harris, he had not much to apostatize from; he possessed a wild, speculative brain. I have heard Joseph correct him and exhort him to repentance for teaching false doctrines."
  source="Brigham Young Addresses, Vol. 4, 1860-1864, Elden J. Watson, p.196-199"
  link="https://cesletter.org/witnesses/8"
/>

Reports assert that he and the other witnesses never literally saw the gold plates, but only an object said to be the plates, covered with a cloth.

Additionally, Martin Harris had a direct conflict of interest in being a witness. He was deeply financially invested in the Book of Mormon as he mortgaged his farm to finance the book.

The following are some accounts of the superstitious side of Martin Harris:

<IndentedQuote
  quote="Once while reading scripture, he reportedly mistook a candle’s sputtering as a sign that the devil desired him to stop. Another time he excitedly awoke from his sleep believing that a creature as large as a dog had been upon his chest, though a nearby associate could find nothing to confirm his fears. Several hostile and perhaps unreliable accounts told of visionary experiences with Satan and Christ, Harris once reporting that Christ had been poised on a roof beam."
  source="Martin Harris: Mormonism’s Early Convert, BYU Professor Ronald W. Walker, p.34-35"
  link="https://cesletter.org/witnesses/9"
/>

<IndentedQuote
  quote="No matter where he went, he saw visions and supernatural appearances all around him. He told a gentleman in Palmyra, after one of his excursions to Pennsylvania, while the translation of the Book of Mormon was going on, that on the way he met the Lord Jesus Christ, who walked along by the side of him in the shape of a deer for two or three miles, talking with him as familiarly as one man talks with another."
  source="John A. Clark letter, August 31, 1840 in Early Mormon Documents 2:271"
/>

<IndentedQuote
  quote="According to two Ohio newspapers, shortly after Harris arrived in Kirtland he began claiming to have ‘seen Jesus Christ and that he is the handsomest man he ever did see. He has also seen the Devil, whom he described as a very sleek haired fellow with four feet, and a head like that of a Jack-ass.’"
  source="Early Mormon Documents 2:271, note 32"
/>

Before Harris became a Mormon, he had already [changed his religion](https://cesletter.org/witnesses/10) at least five times. After Joseph’s death, Harris continued this earlier pattern by joining and leaving 5 more different sects, including that of James Strang (whom Harris went on a mission to England for), other Mormon offshoots, and the Shakers. Not only did Harris join other religions, he testified and witnessed for them. It has been reported that Martin Harris “declared repeatedly that he had as much evidence for a Shaker book he had as for the Book of Mormon” (The Braden and Kelly Debate, p.173).

In addition to his devotion to self-proclaimed prophet James Strang, Martin Harris was a follower to another self-proclaimed Mormon prophet by the name of [Gladden Bishop](https://cesletter.org/witnesses/11). Like Strang, Bishop claimed to have plates, a Urim and Thummim, and that he was receiving revelation from the Lord. Martin was one of [Gladden Bishop’s witnesses](https://www.cesletter.org/witnesses/12) to his claims.

If someone testified to you of an unusual spiritual encounter he had, but he also told you that he...

* Conversed with Jesus who took the form of a deer
* Saw the devil with his four feet and donkey head
* Chipped off a chunk of a stone box that would mysteriously move beneath the ground to avoid capture
* Interpreted simple things like a flickering of a candle as a sign of the devil
* Had a creature appearing on his chest that no one else could see

...would you believe his claims? Or would you call the nearest mental hospital?

With inconsistencies, a conflict of interest, magical thinking, and superstition like this, exactly what credibility does Martin Harris have and why should I believe him?

<ImageWithCaption bottomTitle="David Whitmer" src="/images/placeholder.jpg" />

<IndentedQuote
  quote="David claimed in early June 1829 before their group declaration that he, Cowdery, and Joseph Smith observed ‘one of the Nephites’ carrying the records in a knapsack on his way to Cumorah. Several days later this trio perceived ‘that the Same Person was under the shed’ at the Whitmer farm."
  source="An Insider’s View of Mormon Origins, p.179"
/>

<IndentedQuote
  quote="In 1880, David Whitmer was asked for a description of the angel who showed him the plates. Whitmer responded that the angel ‘had no appearance or shape.’ When asked by the interviewer how he then could bear testimony that he had seen and heard an angel, Whitmer replied, ‘Have you never had impressions?’ To which the interviewer responded, ‘Then you had impressions as the Quaker when the spirit moves, or as a good Methodist in giving a happy experience, a feeling?’ ‘Just so,’ replied Whitmer."
  source="Interview with John Murphy, June 1880, EMD 5:63"
/>

A young Mormon lawyer, James Henry Moyle, who interviewed Whitmer in 1885, asked if there was any possibility that Whitmer had been deceived. “His answer was unequivocal... that he saw the plates and heard the angel with unmistakable clearness.” But Moyle went away “not fully satisfied...It was more spiritual than I anticipated.” – Moyle diary, June 28, 1885, EMD 5:141

Whitmer’s testimony also included the following:

<IndentedQuote
  quote="If you believe my testimony to the Book of Mormon; if you believe that God spake to us three witnesses by his own voice, then I tell you that in June, 1838, God spake to me again by his own voice from the heavens and told me to ‘separate myself from among the Latter Day Saints, for as they sought to do unto me, so it should be done unto them.’"
  attribution="David Whitmer"
  source="An Address to All Believers in Christ (promoting his Whitmerite sect)"
  link="https://cesletter.org/witnesses/13"
/>

If David Whitmer is a credible witness, why are we only using his testimony of the Book of Mormon while ignoring his other testimony claiming that God Himself spoke to Whitmer “by his own voice from the heavens” in June 1838, commanding Whitmer to apostatize from the Lord’s one and only true Church?

<ImageWithCaption bottomTitle="Oliver Cowdery" src="/images/placeholder.jpg" />

Like Joseph and most of the Book of Mormon witnesses, Oliver Cowdery and his family were treasure hunters. Oliver’s preferred tool of trade, as mentioned above, was the divining rod. He was known as a “rodsman.” Along with the witnesses, Oliver held a magical worldview.

Also, Oliver Cowdery was not an objective and independent witness. As scribe for the Book of Mormon, co-founder of the Church, and cousin to Joseph Smith, a conflict of interest existed in Oliver being a witness.

## Second Sight

People believed they could see things as a vision in their mind. They called it “second sight.” We call it “imagination.” It made no difference to these people if they saw with their natural eyes or their spiritual eyes as both were one and the same.

As mentioned previously, people believed they could see spirits and their dwelling places in the local hills along with seeing buried treasure deep in the ground. This supernatural way of seeing the world is also referred in Doctrine & Covenants as “[the eyes of our understanding](https://cesletter.org/witnesses/14).”

If the plates and the experiences were real and tangible as 21st century Mormons are led to believe, why would the witnesses make the following kind of statements when describing the plates and the experience?
